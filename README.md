Alt-Executive Summary - Salvum Apes
===================================

The purpose of this project was to utilise the Kaggle dataset ['Honeybees and Neonic Pesticides']
(https://www.kaggle.com/kevinzmith/honey-with-neonic-pesticide#vHoneyNeonic_v03.csv)
to investigate the potential impact of Neonic pesticides on the honey production of honey bees in the United States.

## Initial Research and Hypotheses

Past research on these pesticides is that, although they do impact bees, they do not kill them. Instead they negatively impact
bee behaviour, and mean they are less efficient pollinators, and thereby produce less honey (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3338325/)
Bees are an essential pollinator of many crops, and we hope this dataset will be able to shed some light on how to prevent
them being negatively impacted by agricultural practices. This could form the basis for future environmental action. 


We set out to investigate three hypotheses:

1) Is there an impact on honey production from increased pesticide use?


2) Which pesticide, if any, is the most significant?


3) Does geographical region matter with respect to honey production?

## Research


In the course of the research and data analysis, we demonstrated that there is, in fact, an impact on production, and that 
one particular pesticide seems to be the most significant (THIAMETHOXAM). Region was shown to be significant, but much more
research is needed before this can be properly explained.

The relationship between overall pesticide use and honey yield was shown to be statistically significant. We chose 1995 and 
2015 as the years to analyse. This was because 1995 was the year post the first recorded usage of the pesticide in the dataset,
and 2015 was the year following the highest usage of the neonics, as per our graph tracking usage over time. We demonstrated that
there was a statistical difference in yield between the two years, as although the overall number of colonies remained the same, 
the yield certainly decreased. This points to the cause being potentially the increased use of these kinds of pesticides.

With this link established, it was then necessary to investigate which pesticide was potentially the most significant, and thereby
having the greatest impact on the yield. This was shown to be THIAMETHOXAM through the boxplot we produced. The use of this
data to our project goal was to show which pesticide to target for action. This action would be to limit the volume used,
so that it may have a less deleterious impact on bee activity. It is much easier to carry out actions with a specific target,
rather than a blanket ban on all neonics, which is much less feasible, and more difficult.

The final analysis taken was over region, and we found that there were statistically significant differences between each region,
as well on the overall yield of honey. The only placed where there seemed to be no difference was between the NE/W and MW/S of
the US. This could be explained potentially in that the climates between these areas is not different enough to impact bee 
activity. However, this cannot be proven objectively at this stage. In future, much more analysis would be necessary to 
pinpoint the reason for these differences, be it number of bee colonies, volume of pesticide, different beekeeping practices
and so on. 


Alt-Conclusions
===============

There does, from out data, seem to be a negative impact on honey yield, and thereby bee health from the use of neonic pesticides.
Further analysis is necessary, but at this point it is important to focus conservation action on limiting use of THIAMETHOXAM in
particular. In future, more research on the climatic angle is also necessary, as the threat of global climate change builds.
